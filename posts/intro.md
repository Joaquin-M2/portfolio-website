# Main titleee

These **web development notes** are the public version of my own notes, which I took during the time I have been learning the necessary skills to become a full-stack developer.

Don&#39;t expect an extraordinary resource of wisdom, since they are just some of my personal notes. Nevertheless, I hope they are still useful enough for somebody beyond myself.

## Secondary titleee

There are many people out there who _altruistically_ shared their knowledge with people like me who, one day, decided to follow the path of becoming a web developer. I hope this is a way I have to pay back my debt with the community, helping others to succeed fulfilling their dreams in the web development field.

### Yeheeey-a

Please, note that since my mother ~~tongue is Spanish~~ , my notes were taken in this language. Nevertheless, I tried to write them down in the most correct Spanish I could, so the output of online tools such as Google Translator or DeepL should be accurate enough.
